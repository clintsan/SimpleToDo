# Project 1 - *SimpleToDo app*

**SimpleToDo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Clinton Chisom Nwokike**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## I had some difficulty with the syntax because it was my first time using kotlin but I was able to get a working app

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

## Notes

My laptop was pretty slow at first with loading the emulator but powred through while recording the gif my laptop battery was low and the battery ended up dying on me so i'm only able to upload certain things
